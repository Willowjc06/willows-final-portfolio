      This semester has been a challenge for me. Before joining the 'Digital Media' course at UWE,
      I had very limited experience in coding and digital design, and even less in designing 3D projects.
      However, I do believe I gave it my best shot, and have , thoroughly enjoyed learning new skills and techniques
      that I was yet to encounter. This project especially was challenging, as I have always believed 
      coding a website was a task only for the experienced, I struggled with the idea of bootstrap and how I could use it to my advantage
      and create a website that was visually appealing, with the toughest challenge being the layout which I used ChatGPT to help me figure out how I should format
      the website and how to actaully use and design the containers. However, after extensive hours of research, I got the hang of how to structure and 
      code things correctly, and I am very delighted with the final result of my website, I feel like it has turned out great, 
      in comparison to my Figma designs, which I found very enjoyable to create. I felt as though I was more comfortable designing 
      the website using Figma, then actually coding it, as I was able to visualise the end result, and had full creative control, as I have always 
      loved being creative and designing things from scratch. Along with designing and making my 3 compostions using figma and the pen tool,
      which were very fun creatively to make, as I have never explored that realm before, and learning the different Gestalt principles and applying that to my own work
      was an enjoyable challenge to overcome. Overall, I am pleased at how far I have come within this first semester, 
      as I feel I have come to know coding and digital design a lot better.
